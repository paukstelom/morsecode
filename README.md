# MorseCodeConverter

A text to morse code converter

## Description

This project is a part of my learning journey and is 100% my own and built from scratch

This program is able to: 
- convert text input to morse code
- display it with sound

If you do not know what is morse code, you can read more about it in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code)

I have also used pytest to write tests and do automating testing during the development
